# CITATION.cff files provide human- & machine-readable citation information for
# software and datasets. GitHub, Zenodo, and the Zotero browser plugin all use
# CFF files automatically if provided. https://citation-file-format.github.io/.

# Tools exist to generate CITATION.cff files from other formats such as BibTeX.

message: If you use this software, please cite it using this metadata.

# CITATION.cff files describe how to cite software or datasets, with the goal of
# making software and data be citable in their own right. However, sometimes
# projects want citations to go to a paper instead. 'Preferred-citation' serves
# to communicate that. The distinction matters in different situations. If this
# field is present, GitHub uses the value for the "cite this repository" button
# and ignores the rest of this file; conversely, the Zenodo-GitHub integration
# ignores this field when creating an entry for a new software release (because
# the Zenodo entry is specifically about the software in this repository).
