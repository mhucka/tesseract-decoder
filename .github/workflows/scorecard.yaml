# Zero-configuration modular workflow to run the OSSF Scorecard scanner.
#
# Scorecard (https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) is a repository-scanning tool
# that evaluates a project's security practices. Its use is suggested by
# Google's GitHub team. Scorecard's findings are reported in a repo's scanning
# results page, https://github.com/quantumlib/REPO/security/code-scanning/.
